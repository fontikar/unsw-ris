## Hey folks! :wave:

Hope everyone's T2 started out smoothly. Another 3 months have flown by and here we our quarterly update!

## Summary

-   We ditched [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) and migrated to [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/)
-   Please submit your availability [in this timeline](https://unsw-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/z3516573_ad_unsw_edu_au1/Documents/UNSW_RIS_2022/RIS_project_planning.xlsx?d=wd594d67bda574876a85c632e9eedd6ae&csf=1&web=1&e=DpItgk) for T1 and T2

## Group decisions :busts_in_silhouette:

### Shiny hosting :globe_with_meridians:

-   We hold a [Posit Connect](https://posit.co/products/enterprise/connect/) license (expires on 26 June) for deploying our Shiny apps. Originally, our plan was to purchase an in-house server for run Posit Connect and apps but this posed a security risk to UNSW infrastructure.
-   I've been working with Michael Grogan (Intersect/ResTech) to set up a virtual instance from [NECTAR](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/auth/login/) as an alternative solution (AUD \$10.77 / day, 8 vcpu 16GB RAM, \$1447 in total).
-   I had some unexpectedly complicated discussions with Posit about the lack of suitability of the Posit Connect license to our project. In a nutshell, we were sold an enterprise level license which is an overkill for our projects' needs. Unfortunately, Posit cannot do anything about the license.

### Our plan :chart_with_upwards_trend:

-   We will cut our losses with our Posit Connect license and migrate to a Professional [shinyapps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) account (USD \$3860 / year or \$349 / month) and not worry about setting our own virtual instance altogether.

-   Our domain looks like this: <https://unsw.shinyapps.io/infinitylists/>
